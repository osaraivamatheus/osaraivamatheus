I have a degree in Actuarial Science, also with an interdisciplinary degree in Science and Economics, and specialization in Modeling in Science and Technology, all from the Federal University of Alfenas - UNIFAL. The subject of my master's dissertation is the comparison of machine learning models for detecting financial fraud, especially the practice of smurfing.
